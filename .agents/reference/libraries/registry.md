# Library llms.txt Registry

A curated list of known `llms.txt` URLs for libraries used in this project.

Both humans and agents should update this file when a new library's `llms.txt` is confirmed.
**Agents must not guess or infer URLs** — only use entries listed here.

## Registry

| Library | llms.txt URL | Notes |
|---------|-------------|-------|
| Cloudflare | https://developers.cloudflare.com/llms.txt | |
| Shadcn UI | https://ui.shadcn.com/llms.txt | |
| Base UI | https://base-ui.com/llms.txt | |

## How to add an entry

1. Find the confirmed `llms.txt` URL (via context7, the library's official docs, or the library's GitHub repo)
2. Verify the URL returns a valid `llms.txt` response
3. Add a row to the table above
