				Probably not &#8212; but here it is anyway. Orel is a software developer
				who drinks too much coffee, runs for fun, lifts weights, plays soccer,
				follows MMA, reads, meditates, and is always trying to learn new things.
				Ore AI is an agent built around all of that: it knows Orel, has tools
				for his interests, and exists mostly because building it sounded like a
				fun learning experience. If you've decided, against all reasonable
				judgement, to give it a try — sign in below.
