				Probably not &#8212; but here it is anyway. Orel is a software developer
				who drinks too much coffee, runs so he can eat more, lifts weights,
				plays soccer, follows MMA, reads, meditates, and is somehow always in
				the middle of learning something new. Ore AI is an agent built around
				all of that: it knows Orel, has tools for his interests, and exists
				mostly because building it sounded more fun than not building it. If for
				some god-knows-what reason you want to give it a try, sign in below.
